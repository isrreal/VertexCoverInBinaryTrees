# Vertex Cover in Binary Trees

This algorithm tackles the NP-complete vertex cover problem within the context of binary trees. It employs a BinarySearchTree class utilizing the singleton design pattern and compares two approaches: recursive and dynamic programming. The goal is to decide the vertex cover problem, which can be done in polynomial time by using a specific graph class known as a tree and optimization techniques like dynamic programming. The algorithm presents the results of these approaches.

## Features

* The code uses Binary Search Trees with randomly assigned values for their nodes, facilitated by a random header.

* The complexity of the first approach, the recursive one, exhibits an exponential worst-case complexity of O(2^n). In contrast, the dynamic programming approach reduces this to a polynomial complexity order of O(n).

## Usage

To compile this program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash

```

To clean dependecies use the following command in your terminal:
