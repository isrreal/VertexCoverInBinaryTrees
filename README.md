# VertexCoverInBinaryTrees

This algorithm is implemented within a BinarySearchTree class, utilizing the singleton design pattern. It addresses an NP-complete vertex cover problem that can be decided in polynomial time by employing a specific graph class known as a tree and optimization techniques called dynamic programming. The algorithm compares two approaches: recursive and dynamic programming, presenting the results.

* Binary Search Trees with randomly assigned values for their nodes, facilitated by a random header, are employed in this code.

* The complexity of the first approach, the recursive one, exhibits an exponential worst-case complexity of O(2^n). In contrast, the dynamic programming approach reduces this to a polynomial complexity order of O(n).
